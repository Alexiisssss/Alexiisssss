Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alexey Volkov, and this is my GitHub profile. Here you will find my projects, experiments, and research on various topics. I am passionate about programming, web development, artificial intelligence, and everything related to technology.

About Me
I have been programming for 3 years. I studied to be a Java developer and have some commercial experience in Java. I constantly improve my skills and knowledge in this programming language with the necessary technology stack for development. I worked in an international company where I wrote VBA macros for Word and Excel documents. I am learning JavaScript + HTML + CSS and have a couple of projects. I have completed many test tasks in this language. Currently, I am learning (working) with 1C-Bitrix. I am also taking courses in artificial intelligence development (Python). I am a versatile and multifaceted person. I easily find compromises and enjoy working in a team. I am persistent and goal-oriented.

Projects
In my repositories, you can find projects of different levels and in different languages. Many are small and non-commercial, but I am working on them, I am striving. After years in IT, I have commercial projects that I cannot post here for various reasons.

Contact
If you have any questions, suggestions, or just want to chat, feel free to contact me via AlexeyYouCan@gmail.com or Telegram @java_DevOps.

Thanks
